# Dragon-Real-Estates-Price-Prediction
I worked on a minor project that involved supervised machine learning and utilized a Regression Model.
The Dragon real estate database made predictions using core machine learning concepts such as 
  - sci-kit learn,
  - pandas,
  - numpy,
  - DecisionTreeRegressor(which showed better accuracy than other models),
  - and matplotlib.

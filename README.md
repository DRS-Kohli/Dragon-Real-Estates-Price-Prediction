# Dragon-Real-Estates-Price-Prediction
I worked on a minor project that involved supervised machine learning and utilized a Regression Model.
Using the Dragon real estate database, predictions were made using core machine learning concepts such as sci-kit learn, pandas, numpy, DecisionTreeRegressor(which showed better accuracy than some other models), matplotlib.
